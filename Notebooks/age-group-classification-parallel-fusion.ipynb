    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project is to further the state-of-the-art in age group classification using multiple touchscreen gestures and parallel fusion. Previous methods for classifying users (as child, teen, or adult) have been performed by other students in the project with Tap, Zoom, and Swipe gestures using machine learning. In order to further the state-of-the-art, this project will combine gestures using three types of parallel fusion to determine the most effective method for age group classification using multiple touchscreen gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the most effective method of parallel fusion for age classification, we must first obtain the same or better results of classification using features of each gesture Swipe, Zoom, and Tap. After classificiton of each gesture is completed, classification with parallel fusion will be performed at the feature level, score level, and decision level. The performance of each level of fusion will be assessed to determine the most effective method for age group classification.\n"

    "This notebook was created on Apple M3 Max with 36 GB of memory. Not everyone has access to these computerers so this notebook can be made to run on Google Colab as well, where students can access shared compute resources with large amounts of RAM. This project has also been reviewed for memory optimization to reduce the amount of memory required to run these notebooks. For example, after loading the Child Safety Dataset, a Python object for each gesture is created as a Pandas Dataframes and exported to the /Checkpoints directory as a Python \"pickle\" file. Working from /Checkpoints allows users to resume their work without the time or space complexity of working with the raw dataset. You can check how much memory is available on your current runtime by running the following code block:"
