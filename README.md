# ChildSafetyProject
Age Detection and Age Group Classification using Touchscreen Gestures with Machine Learning

## Requirements
This project includes the Child_Safety_Data dataset (~5GB)

## Getting Started (Local Jupyter Notebook Runtime with Google Colab)
* Clone this project with Git `git clone https://github.com/tbirms/ChildSafetyProject.git`
* Create a Python virtual environment for the project with `python -m venv myenv`
* Activate the virtual environment with `souce myenv/bin/activate`
* Install requirements with pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start a new Jupyter Notebook instance with `python -m notebook --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://colab.research.google.com' --port=8888 --NotebookApp.port_retries=0`

From here, you can import one of the notebooks from `Notebooks` in Google Colab and connect to your local Jupyter Notebook runtime using the token.
